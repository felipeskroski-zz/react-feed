# React Feed
React feed is a realtime newsfeed similar to instagram (but a lot simpler). This project uses the power of firebase to make the single page application responsive, lightweight, blazing fast and easy to maintain.

Check demo at: https://react-feed-41126.firebaseapp.com/
You need to signup to like, comment and create posts


## Features
### User authentication
The authentication relies on Firebase authentication so it's very easy to add Facebook, Google, Github and Twitter oAuth
- Login
- Signup
- Logout
- Password recovery
- Email confirmation
- User profile page

### Realtime newsfeed (no need for page reload)
Using firebase realtime database the feed is super fast and responsive
- Feed items list (instagram style)
- Feed item create and delete (only authors can delete)
- Comments create and delete (only authors can delete)
- Like / unlike posts
- Image upload to firebase storage

## Dependencies
- **Firebase:** to manage the nosql realtime database, user authentication and file storage
- **Lodash:** makes it simpler to deal with arrays and objects
- **Mobx:** to manage the state (simpler than Redux)
- **Moment:** makes easier to deal with dates
- **react-dropzone:** for drag and drop image uploads
- **react-icons:** enable support for a variety of icons
- **react-router:** takes care of all the routing
- **styled-components:** great to manage styles in a component architecture


## Installation
### Create a firebase account
go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and create an account and create a project.

while testing configure your rules for public access
This does make your database open to anyone, even people not using your app, so be sure to restrict your database again when you set up authentication.

#### Database Rules (optional)
to keep your data a little more secure you can use these rules:
(Keep in mind this is not production ready, for that you may need stricter permissions)
```
{
  "rules": {
    "comments": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null",
      ".indexOn": ["post_id"]
    },
    "posts": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null",
      ".indexOn": ["_id"]
    },
    "users": {
      ".read": true,
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Firebase Config
In your firebase project go to:
- Authentication
and on the top right click:
- WEB SETUP

Copy the info and paste in the config-sample.js in your root directory and save it as config.js

## Add dummy data to your firebase database (optional)
You can import db.json into you firebase database if you want to startup with some data

## Install the app
`npm install` or `yarn install`

## Running the app
`yarn start`

## Firebase Deployment
`yarn build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

Now to use firebase hosting follow these steps:
1. `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. `firebase login`
3. `firebase init`
4. if the init generates an empty file you can paste this inside `firebase.json`:
`{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "package.json",
      "yarn.lock",
      "readme.md",
      "src",
      "node_modules",
      "public"
    ]
  }
}`
5. `firebase serve` - and check if everything is in place. If you're happy it's time to deploy
6. `firebase deploy`
